# AngularBudgetApp
Simple MEAN Stack CRUD Web application(with JWT based authentication) using the Angular as front-end and Express as back-end.

## Setting up an application
Firstly, [Install MongoDB](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/installation/) and run.
Also, the `npm run start-db` may be used for running db locally. 
Then, clone this repo and navigate to the root folder and run `npm install`.

## Development servers

Use `npm run start-dev` for running application in development mode.
The front-end(port 4200) and back-end(port 3000) servers would be running in that case.

## Production server

Use `npm run start-prod` for running application in production mode.
The back-end(port 3000) server would be running in that case.
